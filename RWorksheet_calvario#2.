```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1.
a. Sequence from -5 to 5.
```{r}
seq_vec <- -5:5
seq_vec
```
b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
```{r}
x <- 1:7
x
```
2. 
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
```{r}
vector <- seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
print(vector)
```

3. 
```{r}
ages <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
          22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37,
          43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24, 33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38,
          41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18)

```


a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?'
```{r}
ages[3]
```
b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
```{r}
ages[c(2, 4)]
```
c. Access all but the 4th and 12th element is not
included. Write the R script and its output.
```{r}
ages[-c(4, 12)]
```
4. *Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the
vector, names(x).
```{r}
x <- c("first" = 3, "second" = 0, "third" = 9)
print(names(x))
```
a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")].
Describe the output.
```{r}
result <- x[c("first", "third")]
print(result)
```
5. Create a sequence x from -3:2.
```{r}
x <- -3:2
print(x)
```
a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;
x[2] <- 0
x
Describe the output.
```{r}
x[2] <- 0
print(x)
```
6. *The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.

Month Jan Feb March Apr May June
Price per liter (PhP) 52.50 57.25 60.00 65.00 74.25 54.00
Purchase–quantity(Liters) 25 30 40 50 10 45

a. Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php)
and purchase-quantity (liter). Write the R scripts and
its output.
```{r}
# Creating vectors for each column
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun")
price_per_liter <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
purchase_quantity <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)

# Creating the data frame
fuel_data <- data.frame(month, price_per_liter, purchase_quantity)

# Display the data frame
print(fuel_data)
```
b. What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from
Jan to June? Note: Use ‘weighted.mean(liter,
purchase)‘. Write the R scripts and its output.
